# 🤖 Machine Learning Course Projects

This repository serves as a centralized collection for all projects and assignments completed during my **Machine Learning** course.

## 🎯 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by assignment, with each project residing in its own dedicated directory. This structure ensures modularity and clarity.

* **Project Folders**: Each folder corresponds to a specific assignment (e.g., `ML_HW1`, `Classification_Project`, `Neural_Networks`).
* **Project Specifics**: Inside each project directory, you will find:
    * **`README.md`**: Detailed information about the specific project, including objectives, methodology, and results.
    * **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python libraries and dependencies required to run the code for that particular assignment.
    * **Code Files**: Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts (`.py`) containing the implemented models and analyses.

## ✨ Highlights

Projects cover a range of core Machine Learning topics, including:

* **Support vector machine** (Classification, Optimization)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore any project, navigate to its respective folder.

1.  Review the local `README.md` for the project's context.
2.  Install the required dependencies using the project's `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r [project_folder]/requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Execute the main notebook or script.
