# 🌤️ Sky Image Classification Project

This project classifies sky images into two categories:
- **Clear (s)**
- **Cloudy (c)**

The notebook explores image processing and machine learning techniques to build and evaluate three different classification models.

## 📁 Project Overview
The workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing sky images
- Extracting visual features
- Training multiple ML models
- Evaluating performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Confusion Matrix

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **OpenCV (cv2)** for image processing  
- **NumPy** for numerical operations  
- **Scikit-learn** for evaluation metrics and model performance analysis  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
